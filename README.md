## üîå Backend Connection

This portfolio uses AWS services for backend functionality. There are two ways to set up the backend connection:

### 1. Vercel OIDC Connection (Beta)

If you're deploying on Vercel, you can use the Vercel OIDC connection to securely connect to AWS services without exposing your AWS credentials.

1. Set up OIDC between Vercel and AWS by following the [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/integrations/aws).
2. Once set up, add the following environment variables in your Vercel project settings:
   - `AWS_REGION`: Your AWS region (e.g., `us-west-2`)
   - `AWS_ROLE_ARN`: The ARN of the IAM role you want to assume

### 2. Manual AWS Credentials

If you're not using Vercel or prefer to use AWS credentials directly, you'll need to set the following environment variables:

- `AWS_REGION`: Your AWS region (e.g., `us-west-2`)
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS access key ID
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS secret access key

To set these locally for development:

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project
2. Add the following lines:
   ```
   AWS_REGION=your-aws-region
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
   ```
3. Replace the placeholder values with your actual AWS credentials

**Note:** Never commit your `.env.local` file or expose your AWS credentials publicly.

For production deployment, set these environment variables in your hosting platform's settings.

## üé® Customization

To customize the portfolio for your own use:

1. Update the content in each page component (`app/*/page.tsx`)
2. Modify the `components/responsive-header.tsx` to update the navigation menu
3. Replace images in the `public/` and `assets/` directory with your own
4. Update colors and styles in `tailwind.config.ts` and `styles/globals.css`

## üì¶ Deployment

This portfolio is set up for easy deployment on Vercel:

1. Push your changes to a GitHub repository
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Vercel will automatically deploy your site and provide a URL

For other hosting platforms, build the project using:

```
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```
