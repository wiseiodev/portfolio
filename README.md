## üîå Backend Connection

This portfolio uses AWS services for backend functionality. There are two ways to set up the backend connection:

### 1. Vercel OIDC Connection (Beta)

If you're deploying on Vercel, you can use the Vercel OIDC connection to securely connect to AWS services without exposing your AWS credentials.

1. Set up OIDC between Vercel and AWS by following the [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/integrations/aws).
2. Once set up, add the following environment variables in your Vercel project settings:
   - `AWS_REGION`: Your AWS region (e.g., `us-west-2`)
   - `AWS_ROLE_ARN`: The ARN of the IAM role you want to assume

### 2. Manual AWS Credentials

If you're not using Vercel or prefer to use AWS credentials directly, you'll need to set the following environment variables:

- `AWS_REGION`: Your AWS region (e.g., `us-west-2`)
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS access key ID
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS secret access key

To set these locally for development:

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project
2. Add the following lines:
   ```
   AWS_REGION=your-aws-region
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
   ```
3. Replace the placeholder values with your actual AWS credentials

**Note:** Never commit your `.env.local` file or expose your AWS credentials publicly.

For production deployment, set these environment variables in your hosting platform's settings.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Integration

This portfolio uses [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) and [Vercel DB](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres) for database management.

### Setting Up the Database

1. Ensure you have the necessary environment variables set up in your `.env.local` file:

```
POSTGRES_URL=your-postgres-url
```

2. The database schema is defined using Drizzle ORM in the [`db/schema`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fwise%2Fdev%2Fwiseio%2Fdb%2Fschema%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D '/Users/wise/dev/wiseio/db/schema') directory. For example, the [technologies schema](db/schema/technologies/index.ts) and [projects schema](db/schema/projects/index.ts).

3. To generate and run migrations, use the following commands:

```bash
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate
```

4. To seed the database with initial data, use:

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

This will add technology and categories, as well as my initial projects, which you can erase or use as a sample to guide you.

### Database Configuration

The database configuration is defined in [`drizzle.config.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fwise%2Fdev%2Fwiseio%2Fdrizzle.config.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D '/Users/wise/dev/wiseio/drizzle.config.ts'):

```ts
import '@/db/env-config';

import { defineConfig } from 'drizzle-kit';

export default defineConfig({
  dialect: 'postgresql',
  schema: './db/schema',
  out: './db/migrations',
  dbCredentials: {
    url: process.env.POSTGRES_URL || 'no-db-url-found'
  }
});
```

### Database Connection

The database connection is established db/index.ts:

```ts
import * as schema from '@/db/schema';

import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/vercel-postgres';
import { sql } from '@vercel/postgres';

export const db = drizzle(sql, { schema });
```

## üé® Customization

To customize the portfolio for your own use:

1. Update the content in each page component (`app/*/page.tsx`)
2. Modify the `components/responsive-header.tsx` to update the navigation menu
3. Replace images in the `public/` and `assets/` directory with your own
4. Update colors and styles in `tailwind.config.ts` and `styles/globals.css`

## üì¶ Deployment

This portfolio is set up for easy deployment on Vercel:

1. Push your changes to a GitHub repository
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Vercel will automatically deploy your site and provide a URL

For other hosting platforms, build the project using:

```
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```
